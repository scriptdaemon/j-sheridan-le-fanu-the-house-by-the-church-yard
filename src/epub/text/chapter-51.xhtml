<h2>CHAPTER LI.</h2>
<h4>HOW CHARLES NUTTER'S TEA, PIPE, AND TOBACCO-BOX WERE ALL SET OUT FOR HIM
IN THE SMALL PARLOUR AT THE MILLS; AND HOW THAT NIGHT WAS PASSED IN THE
HOUSE BY THE CHURCH-YARD.</h4>
<div class="figleft"><img alt="ORNAMENTAL CAPITAL 'M'" src="images/img048.jpg" title="ORNAMENTAL CAPITAL 'M'"/></div><p>rs. Nutter and Mrs. Sturk, the wives of the two men who most hated one
another within the vicinage of Chapelizod—natural enemies, holding
aloof one from another, and each regarding the other in a puzzled way,
with a sort of apprehension and horror, as the familiar of that worst
and most formidable of men—her husband—were this night stricken with a
common fear and sorrow.</p>
<p>Darkness descended on the Mills and the river—a darkness deepened by
the umbrageous trees that grouped about the old gray house in which poor
Mrs. Nutter lay so ill at ease. Moggy carried the jingling tray of
tea-things into Nutter's little study, and lighted his candles, and set
the silver snuffers in the dish, and thought she heard him coming, and
ran back again, and returned with the singing 'tea-kitchen,' and then
away again, for the thin buttered toast under its china cover, which our
ancestors loved.</p>
<p>Then she listened—but 'twas a mistake—it was the Widow Macan's step,
who carried the ten pailfuls of water up from the river to fill the butt
in the backyard every Tuesday and Friday, for a shilling a week, and 'a
cup o' tay with the girls in the kitchen.'</p>
<p>Then Moggy lighted the fire with the stump of a candle, for the night
was a little chill, and she set the small round table be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214" name="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>side it, and
laid her master's pipe and tobacco-box on it, and listened, and began to
wonder what detained him.</p>
<p>So she went out into the sharp still air, and stood on the hall-door
step, and listened again. Presently she heard the Widow Macan walking up
from the garden with the last pail on her head, who stopped when she saw
her, and set down the vessel upon the corner of the clumsy little
balustrade by the door-step. So Moggy declared her uneasiness, which
waxed greater when Mrs. Macan told her that 'the masther, God bless him,
wasn't in the garden.'</p>
<p>She had seen him standing at the river's edge, while she passed and
repassed. He did not move a finger, or seem to notice her, and was
looking down into the water. When she came back the third or fourth
time, he was gone.</p>
<p>At Moggy's command she went back into the garden, though she assured
her, solemnly—''twas nansince lookin' there'—and called Mr. Nutter, at
first in a deferential and hesitating way; but, emboldened and excited
by the silence, for she began to feel unaccountably queer, in a louder
and louder a key, till she was certain that he was neither in the garden
nor in the orchard, nor anywhere near the house. And when she stopped,
the silence seemed awful, and the darkness under the trees closed round
her with a supernatural darkness, and the river at the foot of the walk
seemed snorting some inarticulate story of horror. So she locked the
garden door quickly, looking over her shoulder for she knew not what,
and ran faster than she often did along the sombre walk up to the hall
door, and told her tale to Moggy, and begged to carry the pail in by the
hall-door.</p>
<p>In they came, and Moggy shut the hall-door, and turned the key in it.
Perhaps 'twas the state in which the poor lady lay up stairs that helped
to make them excited and frightened. Betty was sitting by her bedside,
and Toole had been there, and given her some opiate, I suppose, for she
had dropped into a flushed snoring sleep, a horrid counterfeit of
repose. But she had first had two or three frightful fits, and all sorts
of wild, screaming talk between. Perhaps it was the apparition of Mary
Matchwell, whose evil influence was so horribly attested by the dismal
spectacle she had left behind her, that predisposed them to panic; but
assuredly each anticipated no good from the master's absence, and had a
foreboding of something bad, of which they did not speak; but only
disclosed it by looks, and listening, and long silences. The lights
burning in Nutter's study invited them, and there the ladies seated
themselves, and made their tea in the kitchen tea-pot, and clapped it on
the hob, and listened for sounds from Mrs. Nutter's chamber, and for the
step of her husband crossing the little court-yard; and they grew only
more nervous from listening, and there came every now and then a little
tapping on the window-pane. It was only, I think, a little sprig of the
climbing-rose that was nailed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215" name="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> wall, nodding at every breath, and
rapping like unseen finger-tops, on the glass. But, as small things
will, with such folk, under such circumstances, it frightened them
confoundedly.</p>
<p>Then, on a sudden, there came a great yell from poor Mrs. Nutter's
chamber, and they both stood up very pale. The Widow Macan, with the cup
in her hand that she was 'tossing' at the moment, and Moggy, all aghast,
invoked a blessing under her breath, and they heard loud cries and
sudden volleys of talk, and Biddy's voice, soothing the patient.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Nutter had started up, all on a sudden, from her narcotic
doze, with a hideous scream that had frightened the women down stairs.
Then she cried—</p>
<p>'Where am I?' and 'Oh, the witch—the witch!'</p>
<p>'Oh! no, Ma'am, dear,' replied Betty; 'now, aisy, Ma'am, darling.'</p>
<p>'I'm going mad.'</p>
<p>'No, Ma'am, dear?—there now—sure 'tis poor Betty that's in it—don't
be afear'd, Ma'am.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Betty, hold me—don't go—I'm mad—am I mad?'</p>
<p>Then in the midst of Betty's consolations, she broke into a flood of
tears, and seemed in some sort relieved; and Betty gave her her drops
again, and she began to mumble to herself, and so to doze.</p>
<p>At the end of another ten minutes, with a scream, she started up again.</p>
<p>'That's her step—where are you, Betty?' she shrieked, and when Betty
ran to the bedside, she held her so hard that the maid was ready to cry
out, leering all the time over her shoulder—'Where's Charles Nutter?—I
saw him speaking to you.'</p>
<p>Then the poor little woman grew quieter, and by her looks and moans, and
the clasping of her hands, and her upturned eyes, seemed to be praying;
and when Betty stealthily opened the press to take out another candle,
her poor mistress uttered another terrible scream, crying—</p>
<p>'You wretch! her head won't fit—you can't hide her;' and the poor woman
jumped out of her bed, shrieking 'Charles, Charles, Charles!'</p>
<p>Betty grew so nervous and frightened, that she fairly bawled to her
colleague, Moggy, and told her she would not stay in the room unless she
sat up all night with her. So, together they kept watch and ward, and as
the night wore on, Mrs. Nutter's slumbers grew more natural and less
brief, and her paroxysms of waking terror less maniacal. Still she would
waken, with a cry that thrilled them, from some frightful vision, and
seem to hear or see nothing aright for a good while after, and muttering
to the frightened maids—</p>
<p>'Listen to the knocking—oh!—breathing outside the door—bolt it,
Betty—girls, say your prayers—'tis he,' or sometimes, ''tis she.'<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216" name="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>And thus this heavy night wore over; and the wind, which began to rise
as the hours passed, made sounds full of sad untranslatable meaning in
the ears of the watchers.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Sturk meanwhile, in the House by the Church-yard, sat
listening and wondering, and plying her knitting-needles in the
drawing-room. When the hour of her Barney's expected return had passed
some time, she sent down to the barrack, and then to the club, and then
on to the King's House, with her service to Mrs. Stafford, to enquire,
after her spouse. But her first and her second round of enquiries,
despatched at the latest minute at which she was likely to find any body
out of bed to answer them, were altogether fruitless. And the lights
went out in one house after another, and the Phœnix shut its doors,
and her own servants were for hours gone to bed; and the little town of
Chapelizod was buried in the silence of universal slumber. And poor Mrs.
Sturk still sat in her drawing-room, more and more agitated and
frightened.</p>
<p>But her missing soldier did not turn up, and Leonora sat and listened
hour after hour. No sound of return, not even the solemn clank and fiery
snort of the fiend-horse under her window, or the 'ho-lo, ho-la—my
life, my love!' of the phantom rider, cheated her with a momentary hope.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Sturk! She raised the window a few inches, that she might the
better hear the first distant ring of his coming on the road. She forgot
he had not his horse that night, and was but a pedestrian. But somehow
the night-breeze through the aperture made a wolfish howling and
sobbing, that sounded faint and far away, and had a hateful character of
mingled despair and banter in it.</p>
<p>She said every now and then aloud, to reassure herself—'What a noise
the wind makes to be sure!' and after a while she opened the window
wider. But her candle flared, and the flame tossed wildly about, and the
perplexed lady feared it might go out absolutely. So she shut down the
window altogether; for she could not bear the ill-omened baying any
longer.</p>
<p>So it grew to be past two o'clock, and she was afraid that Barney would
be very angry with her for sitting up, should he return.</p>
<p>She went to bed, therefore, where she lay only more
feverish—conjecturing, and painting frightful pictures, till she heard
the crow of the early village cock, and the caw of the jackdaw wheeling
close to the eaves as he took wing in the gray of the morning to show
her that the business of a new day had commenced; and yet Barney had not
returned.</p>
<p>Not long after seven o'clock, Dr. Toole, with Juno, Cæsar, Dido, and
Sneak at his heels, paid his half-friendly, half-professional visit at
the Mills.</p>
<p>Poor little Mrs. Nutter was much better—quiet for her was everything,
packed up, of course, with a little physic; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217" name="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> having comforted her,
as well as he was able, he had a talk with Moggy in the hall, and all
about Nutter's disappearance, and how Mrs. Macan saw him standing by the
river's brink, and that was the last anyone near the house had seen of
him; and a thought flashed upon Toole, and he was very near coming out
with it, but checked himself, and only said—</p>
<p>'What hat had he on?'</p>
<p>So she told him.</p>
<p>'And was his name writ in it, or how was it marked?'</p>
<p>'Two big letters—a C and an N.'</p>
<p>'I see; and do you remember any other mark you'd know it by?'</p>
<p>'Well, yes; I stitched the lining only last month, with red silk, and
that's how I remember the letters.'</p>
<p>'I know; and are you sure it was that hat he had on?'</p>
<p>'Certain sure—why, there's all the rest;' and she conned them over, as
they hung on their pegs on the rack before them.</p>
<p>'Now, don't let the mistress be downhearted—keep her up, Moggy, do you
mind. I told her the master was with Lord Castlemallard since yesterday
evening, on business, and don't you say anything else; keep her quiet,
do ye mind, and humour her.'</p>
<p>And away went Toole, at a swift pace, to the town again, and entered the
barrack, and asked to see the adjutant, and then to look at the hat the
corporal had fished up by 'Bloody Bridge;' and, by Jupiter! his heart
gave a couple of great bounces, and he felt himself grow pale—they were
the identical capitals, C N, and the clumsy red silk stitching in the
lining.</p>
<p>Toole was off forthwith, and had a fellow dragging the river before
three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<p>Dr. Walsingham, returning from an early ride to Island Bridge, saw this
artist at work, with his ropes and great hooks, at the other side of the
river; and being a man of enquiring mind, and never having witnessed the
process before, he cried out to him, after some moments lost in
conjecture—</p>
<p>'My good man, what are you fishing for?'</p>
<p>'A land-agent,' answered Isaac Walton.</p>
<p>'A land-agent?' repeated the rector, misdoubting his ears.</p>
<p>The saturnine angler made no answer.</p>
<p>'And has a gentleman been drowned here?' he persisted.</p>
<p>The man only looked at him across the stream, and nodded.</p>
<p>'Eh! and his name, pray?'</p>
<p>'Old Nutter, of the Mills,' he replied.</p>
<p>The rector made a woeful ejaculation, and stared at the careless
operator, who had a pipe in his mouth the while, which made him averse
from conversation. He would have liked to ask him more questions, but he
was near the village, and refrained himself; and he met Toole at the
corner of the bridge who, leaning on the shoulder of the rector's horse,
gave him the sad story in full.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218" name="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
