<h2>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>
<h4>RELATING AFTER WHAT FASHION DR. STURK CAME HOME.</h4>
<div class="figleft"><img alt="ORNAMENTAL CAPITAL 'A'" src="images/img003.jpg" title="ORNAMENTAL CAPITAL 'A'"/></div><p>s Dangerfield, having parted company with Irons at the corner of the
bridge, was walking through the town, with his rod over his shoulder and
his basket of troutlings by his side, his attention was arrested by a
little knot of persons in close and earnest talk at the barrack-gate,
nearly opposite Sturk's house.</p>
<p>He distinguished at a glance the tall grim figure of Oliver Lowe, of
Lucan, the sternest and shrewdest magistrate who held the commission for
the county of Dublin in those days, mounted on his iron-gray hunter, and
holding the crupper with his right hand, as he leaned toward a ragged,
shaggy little urchin, with naked shins, whom he was questioning, as it
seemed closely. Half-a-dozen gaping villagers stood round.</p>
<p>There was an indescribable something about the group which indicated
horror and excitement. Dangerfield quickened his pace, and arrived just
as the adjutant rode out.</p>
<p>Saluting both as he advanced, Dangerfield asked—</p>
<p>'Nothing amiss, I hope, gentlemen?'</p>
<p>'The surgeon here's been found murdered in the park!' answered Lowe.</p>
<p>'Hey—<i>Sturk</i>?' said Dangerfield.</p>
<p>'Yes,' said the adjutant: 'this boy here says he's found him in the
Butcher's Wood.'</p>
<p>'The Butcher's Wood!—why, what the plague brought him <i>there</i>?'
exclaimed Dangerfield.</p>
<p>''Tis his straight road from Dublin across the park,' observed the
magistrate.</p>
<p>'Oh!—I thought 'twas the wood by Lord Mountjoy's,' said Dangerfield;
'and when did it happen?'</p>
<p>'Pooh!—some time between yesterday afternoon and half an hour ago,'
answered Mr. Lowe.</p>
<p>'Nothing known?' said Dangerfield. ''Twill be a sad hearing over the
way;' and he glared grimly with a little side-nod at the doctor's house.</p>
<p>Then he fell, like the others, to questioning the boy. He could tell
them but little—only the same story over and over. Coming out of town,
with tea and tobacco, a pair of shoes, and a bottle of whisky, for old
Mrs. Tresham—in the thick of the wood, among brambles, all at once he
lighted on the body. He could not mistake Dr. Sturk; he wore his
regimentals; there was blood about him; he did not touch him, nor go
nearer than a musket's length to him, and being frightened at the sight
in that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222" name="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> lonely place he ran away and right down to the barrack, where
he made his report.</p>
<p>Just then out came Sergeant Bligh, with his men—two of them carrying a
bier with a mattress and cloaks thereupon. They formed, and accompanied
by the adjutant, at quick step marched through the town for the park.
Mr. Lowe accompanied them, and in the park-lane they picked up the
ubiquitous Doctor Toole, who joined the party.</p>
<p>Dangerfield walked a while beside the adjutant's horse; and, said he—</p>
<p>'I've had as much walking as I can well manage this morning, and you
don't want for hands, so I'll turn back when I've said just a word in
your ear. You know, Sir, funerals are expensive, and I happen to know
that poor Sturk was rather pressed for money—in fact, 'twas only the
day before yesterday I myself lent him a trifle. So will you, through
whatever channel you think best, let poor Mrs. Sturk know that she may
draw upon me for a hundred pounds, if she requires it?'</p>
<p>'Thank you, Mr. Dangerfield; I certainly shall.'</p>
<p>And so Dangerfield lifted his hat to the party and fell behind, and came
to a stand still, watching them till they disappeared over the brow of
the hill.</p>
<p>When he reached his little parlour in the Brass Castle, luncheon was
upon the table. But he had not much of an appetite, and stood at the
window, looking upon the river with his hands in his pockets, and a
strange pallid smile over his face, mingling with the light of the
silver spectacles.</p>
<p>'When Irons hears of this,' he said, 'he'll come to my estimate of
Charles Archer, and conclude he has had a finger in that pretty pie;
'twill frighten him.'</p>
<p>And somehow Dangerfield looked a little bit queer himself, and he drank
off two small glasses, such as folks then used in Ireland—of Nantz; and
setting down the glass, he mused—</p>
<p>'A queer battle life is; ha, ha! Sturk laid low—the wretched fool!
Widow—yes; children—ay. Charles! Charles! if there be a reckoning
after death, your score's an ugly one. I'm tired of playing my part in
this weary game of defence. Irons and I remain with the secret between
us. Glasscock had his fourth of it, and tasted death. Then we three had
it; and Sturk goes next; and now I and Irons—Irons and I—which goes
first?' And he fell to whistling slowly and dismally, with his hands in
his breeches' pockets, looking vacantly through his spectacles on the
ever-running water, an emblem of the eternal change and monotony of
life.</p>
<p>In the meantime the party, with Tim Brian, the bare-shanked urchin,
still in a pale perspiration, for guide, marched on, all looking ahead,
in suspense, and talking little.</p>
<p>On they marched, till they got into the bosky shadow of the close old
whitethorn and brambles, and there, in a lonely nook,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223" name="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> the small birds
hopping on the twigs above, sure enough, on his back, in his
regimentals, lay the clay-coloured image of Sturk, some blood, nearly
black now, at the corners of his mouth, and under his stern brows a
streak of white eye-ball turned up to the sky.</p>
<p>There was a pool of blood under his pomatumed, powdered, and curled
head, more under his right arm, which was slightly extended, with the
open hand thrown palm upwards, as if appealing to heaven.</p>
<p>Toole examined him.</p>
<p>'No pulse, by Jove! Quiet there! don't stir!' Then he clapped his ear on
Sturk's white Marseilles vest.</p>
<p>'Hush!' and a long pause. Then Toole rose erect, but still on his knees,
'<i>Will</i> you be quiet there? I think there's some little action still;
only don't talk, or shift your feet; and just—just, do be quiet!'</p>
<p>Then Toole rose to his knees again, with a side glance fixed on the face
of Sturk, with a puzzled and alarmed look. He evidently did not well
know what to make of it. Then he slipped his hand within his vest, and
between his shirt and his skin.</p>
<p>'If he's dead, he's not long so. There's warmth here. And see, get me a
pinch or two of that thistle-down, d'ye see?'</p>
<p>And with the help of this improvised test he proceeded to try whether he
was still breathing. But there was a little air stirring, and they could
not manage it.</p>
<p>'Well!' said Toole, standing this time quite erect, 'I—I think there's
life there still. And now, boys, d'ye see? lift him very carefully, d'ye
mind? Gently, very gently, for I tell you, if this hæmorrhage begins
again, he'll not last twenty seconds.'</p>
<p>So on a cloak they lifted him softly and deftly to the bier, and laid
covering over him; and having received Toole's last injunctions, and
especially a direction to Mrs. Sturk to place him in a well-warmed bed,
and introduce a few spoonfuls of warm port wine negus into his mouth,
and if he swallowed, to continue to administer it from time to time,
Sergeant Bligh and his men commenced their funereal march toward Sturk's
house.</p>
<p>'And now, Mr. Adjutant,' said Lowe, 'had not we best examine the ground,
and make a search for anything that may lead to a conviction?'</p>
<p>Well, a ticket was found trod into the bloody mud, scarcely legible, and
Sturk's cocked hat, the leaf and crown cut through with a blow of some
blunt instrument. His sword they had found by his side not drawn.</p>
<p>'See! here's a foot-print, too,' said Lowe; 'don't move!'</p>
<p>It was remarkable. They pinned together the backs of two letters, and
Toole, with his surgical scissors, cut the pattern to fit exactly into
the impression; and he and Lowe, with great care, pencilled in the
well-defined marks of the great hob-nails, and a sort of seam or scar
across the heel.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224" name="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright"><img alt="FOOTPRINT" src="images/img231.jpg" title="FOOTPRINT"/></div>
<p>'Twas pretty much after this fashion. It was in a slight dip in the
ground where the soil continued soft. They found it in two other places
coming up to the fatal spot, from the direction of the Magazine. And it
was traceable on for some twenty yards more faintly; then, again, very
distinctly, where—a sort of ditch interposing—a jump had been made,
and here it turned down towards the park wall and the Chapelizod road,
still, however, slanting in the Dublin direction.</p>
<p>In the hollow by the park wall it appeared again, distinctly; and here
it was plain the transit of the wall had been made, for the traces of
the mud were evident enough upon its surface, and the mortar at top was
displaced, and a little tuft of grass in the mud, left by the clodded
shoesole. Here the fellow had got over.</p>
<p>They followed, and, despairing of finding it upon the road, they
diverged into the narrow slip of ground by the river bank, and just
within the park-gate, in a slight hollow, the clay of which was still
impressible, they found the track again. It led close up to the river
bank, and there the villain seemed to have come to a stand still; for
the sod just for so much as a good sized sheet of letter-paper might
cover, was trod and broken, as if at the water's edge he had stood for a
while, and turned about and shifted his feet, like a fellow that is
uneasy while he is stationary.</p>
<p>From this stand-point they failed to discover any receding foot-print;
but close by it came a little horse track, covered with shingle, by
which, in those days, the troops used to ride their horses to water. He
might have stepped upon this, and following it, taken to the streets; or
he might—and this was Lowe's theory—have swam the river at this point,
and got into some of those ruffian haunts in the rear of Watling and St.
James's streets. So Lowe, who, with a thief or a murderer in the wind,
had the soul of a Nimrod, rode round to the opposite bank, first telling
Toole, who did not care to press his services at Sturk's house,
uninvited, that he would send out the great Doctor Pell to examine the
patient, or the body, as the case might turn out.</p>
<p>By this time they were carrying Doctor Sturk—that gaudy and dismal
image—up his own staircase—his pale wife sobbing and shivering on the
landing, among whispered ejaculations from the maids, and the speechless
wonder of the awe-stricken children, staring through the banisters—to
lay him in the bed where at last he is to lie without dreaming.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225" name="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
